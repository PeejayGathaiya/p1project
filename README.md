# p1project
This contains my final project of the first phase of the software engineering course.

The project is a quote generator, that upon the click of a button will generate a random quote for the user.

It also provides the user with the author of the quote.

It uses fetch() to get data from API from 'https://api.quotable.io/random'.

The website has been deployed to github pages and can be viewed on 'https://peejaygathaiya.github.io/'.
